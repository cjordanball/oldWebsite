            <h2>A Fun Little Project<br/><a style='color: navy' target='_blank' href='/sudoku'>Sudoku Solver</a></h2>

No longer will you need to waste hours filling in those spaces, when this Sudoku app can do it for you in milliseconds!  This trifle was written as an example of app without persistant data, uses React.js to set up page, and uses Babel to allow the import/export module syntax from ECMA-6 script. A fun way to test the speed and efficiency of various approaches.

                <p class='lead'>ByteBites</a> presents my solutions to each of the one hundred fourteen coding challenges taken from the coderbyte.com website, most with comments on points of interest contained in each problem.

                <p class="lead">Finding compatible playing partners is one of the great challenges for amateur musicians; a mismatch may lead to an experience that may be boring, terrifying, or simply uninspiring.  A Joyous Noise is aimed at helping classical musicians find suitable ensemble partners, no matter what their level of experience and ability, or their stylistic preferences.

            <h2>HanType: Learn to Type in Korean<br/><a style='color: navy' target='_blank' href='https://hantype.herokuapp.com'>한타이프</a></h2>

Okay, this may not be just the thing you were thinking you need, but wouldn't it be cool to be able to type in Hangul, the Korean alphabet invented by King Sejong in the 15th century. Written as a project for the Web Immersive Development course at General Assembly, this web-app employs a Sails framework, with Javascript, Node.js, Angular, and MongoDB.

This app was an experiment in developing an application that is completely scalable, using viewport units for all size values, and completely bypassing Bootstrap and other design frameworks.

                <p class="lead">All that <span style='color: red'>/^[]\d^$($:\w+){3}$/</span> stuff can be intimidating on first glance, to say the least.  And there is certainly plenty one can do in code without ever using regular expressions.  But having them as an available tool will often simplify your life tremendously and will, at the least, make you appear exquisitely knowledgeable (perhaps even heroic).</p>
                <p class='lead'>This guide takes the reader step-by-step through the world of regular expressions as used in Javascript, examining not only the rules for formatting and reading valid regular expressions, but also the manner in which they are used in various RegExp and String methods.</p>

                <p class="lead">It really is not a difficult concept at all to understand, assuming one has a solid background on the Javascript fundamentals leading up to it, and yet I have seen numerous explanations of the concept of closure ranging from ridiculous to unhelpful, with just a few that are enlightening.</p>
                <p class='lead'>This outline hopefully strikes the right balance of clarity and thoroughness in presentation, to explain a concept that is basic to modern Javascript usage.

                <p class="lead">I recently completed one of the great learning experiences of my life, the online offering of Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science, more commonly known as CS50.  I could advocate at length regarding the merits of this course, but I think the fact that Yale has adopted it as their introductory computer science course says it all!</p>
                <p class="lead">Although it is clear from the videos of Dr. David Malan's lectures that the live class is lots of fun, I think the edX version may be an even better learning experience, given the quality of materials provided, and the absence of time restrictions present in a "live" course.  Indeed, I took two months off from the coursework to take a detour into the world of C, allowing me to focus on the the more advanced problem sets without the distraction of syntax issues.</p>
